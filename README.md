This repository contains jupyter notebooks conataining all the progress made for the project "Dependence of Phase Measurement Error on Object Sparsity"


1) In "BTP_task2 (1).ipynb" work on phase only optimisation and testing on real RBC cells is documented.
2) In "btp_task1.py" work on developing constraint optimisation and establishing relation between object sparsity, error and complexity is documented. 
3) "btp_report.pdf" contains the comprehensive description of theoretical framework, results and discussion.
