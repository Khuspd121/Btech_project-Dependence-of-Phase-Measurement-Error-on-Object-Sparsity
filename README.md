This repository contains jupyter notebooks conataining all the progress made for the project "Dependence of Phase Measurement Error on Object Sparsity"
In "BTP_task2.ipynb" work on phase only optimisation and testing on real RBC cells is documented.
In "btp_task1.py" work on developing constraint optimisation and establishing relation between object sparsity, error and complexity is documented.
